This project is a translation of this [article](https://medium.com/@kosamari/how-to-be-a-compiler-make-a-compiler-with-javascript-4a8a13d473b4) about how to build a compiler with javascript into
haskell. 

In the article, the author demonstrates how to build a simple compiler for the visual language [design by numbers](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-numbers) which takes some written commands and compiles them into an svg image.
